# Data cleaning

What we have did here is below :

1. STANDARDIZE DATE FORMAT
2. ENSURE DATATYPE DOESN'T UPDATE THE UPDATE DATA TYPE PROPERLY
3. POPULATE PROPERTY ADDRESS DATA
4. BREAKING OUT ADDRESS INTO INDIVIDUAL COLUMNS (ADDRESS, CITY, STATE)
5. CHANGE Y AND N TO YES AND NO IN "SOLD AS VACANT" FIELD
6. REMOVE DUPLICATES
7. DELETE UNUSED COLUMNS
8. CAST TO APPROPRIATE DATATYPE
9. NULL HANDLING USING ISNULL, COALESCE, CASE
10. AGGRATING DATA
