# Data cleaning

What we have did here is below :

1. STANDARDIZE DATE FORMAT

2. ENSURE DATATYPE DOESN'T UPDATE THE UPDATE DATA TYPE PROPERLY

3. POPULATE PROPERTY ADDRESS DATA

4. BREAKING OUT ADDRESS INTO INDIVIDUAL COLUMNS (ADDRESS, CITY, STATE)

5. CHANGE Y AND N TO YES AND NO IN "SOLD AS VACANT" FIELD

6. REMOVE DUPLICATES

7. DELETE UNUSED COLUMNS

8. CAST TO APPROPRIATE DATATYPE
